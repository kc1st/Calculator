Assignment #2:

Write a simple calculator program that can do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

The program should initially accept 2 operands and a mathematical operator (+, -, *, /) then store the results. The succeeding steps should only ask for the operator and a new input number. The operator would then be applied to the previously stored result and the new input number. Also include two special special operators, c and x, where c would clear the buffer and x will exit the program.

Ex (the blue text indicates user input):
    1st input: 3
    op: +
    2nd input: 2.5
    ans: 5.5
    op: *
    more input: 3
    ans: 16.5
    op: c
    ans: 0.0
    op: +
    more input: 10
    ans: 10.0
    op: x
  
Your program should also display an error message if the user attempts to divide a number by 0. The buffer should not be cleared if this error occured.

Ex:

    1st input: -3
    op: *
    2nd input: 2
    ans: -6.0
    op: /
    more input: 0
    Error: division by zero
    op: +
    more input: 10
    ans: 4.0
  
Similarly, your program should display an error message for any unrecognized operator. It should also not affect the value of the buffer.

Ex:

    1st input: -3
    op: $
    2nd input: 2
    Error: Unknown operator $
    op: +
    more input: 6
    ans: 3.0
